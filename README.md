# Hands on POC with Playwright using JAVA

I have used screen play design pattern for this project
Screen play is good at addressing the issue with page object pattern
It allows us to relook at the automation in different paridigm.
with use of SOLID principle it makes code less complicated and more modular
It helps use to come up with DSL for our automation
